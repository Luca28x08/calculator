‚ùì What is it?
---
This calculator was written in Python and can be used for the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

ü§î How can I use it?
---
To use the calculator, run the Python code and enter the desired arithmetic operation by inputting the number 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Then, input the two numbers on which the arithmetic operation is to be performed.

The result of the calculation will then be displayed on the screen.

The code contains four functions, one for each of the four basic arithmetic operations. Each function accepts two numbers as arguments and returns the result of the calculation.

The functions are then called based on user input to perform the corresponding arithmetic operation.
